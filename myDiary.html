            <p>A diary is where you keep personal musings about your life, the people in it and the things you care about. Your diary is a safe place where you can be honest and candid about your thoughts, feelings and opinions. Diaries are for the eyes of their owners and no one else. Your diary is for you and by you. Reflect, create, dream. Do whatever you want with your words.
            </p>
            <p>A diary entry is a section of writing that has been organized by date. The entries within your diary are how you organize the thoughts, feelings and opinions you are pouring into it. They break up your diary into smaller pieces. Think of them like chapters of a book. They can be as short or as long as you want.</p>
